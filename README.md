## FortiGate-VM (BYOL/PAYG) on Azure

A Terraform script to deploy a single FortiGate-VM on Azure 

## Introduction
* port1 - public/untrust with public IP
* port2 - private/trust

## Requirements

* [Terraform](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/install.html) >= 0.12.0
* Terraform Provider AzureRM >= 2.24.0
* Terraform Provider Template >= 2.2.0
* Terraform Provider Random >= 3.1.0

## Deployment overview
Terraform deploys the following components:

* Azure Virtual Network with 4 subnets - external, internal, 2x workload subnets
* 1x FortiGate-VM (BYOL/PAYG) instances with two NICs.  
* Untrust interface placed in SD-WAN zone "Underlay".
* 2x firewall rules - permit outbound, and permit internal.
* Azure SDN connector using managed identity with reader.
* 2x Ubuntu 20.04 LTS test client VMs in each workload subnet.
* UDRs for internal subnet routing table for default routing and inter-subnet routing through FortiGate
* FortiGate - Choose payg or byol in "license_type" variable (lowercase) - if byol and using license file, place .lic files in subfolder "licenses", define filename in "fgtlicense" variable and DO NOT populate the "fgtflextoken" variable. If using flex-vm, define token in "fgtflextoken" variable and DO NOT populate the "fgtlicense" variable. DO NOT populate a flex token variable if using a license file or vice versa.
* Terraform backend (versions.tf) stored in Azure storage - customise backend.conf to suit when initialising or modify as appropriate. An backend.conf.example is provided or comment out the backend "azurerm" resource block.

## Deployment

To deploy the FortiGate-VM to Azure:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Customize variables defined in `variables.tf` file as needed with a standard *.auto.tfvars file. An example is provided.
3. Initialize the providers defining the backend (terraform init -backend-config=backend.conf) and run terraform as normal.

Outputs:

- PublicIP = <Cluster Public IP>
- Password = <FGT Password>
- ResourceGroup = <Resource Group>
- Username = <FGT admin>
- VNET_CIDR = <vnet summary route>

Azure credentials:

The following code is commented out in provider.tf that can be uncommented to run via a service principal

- subscription_id = var.subscription_id
- client_id       = var.client_id
- client_certificate_path   = var.client_certificate_path
- tenant_id       = var.tenant_id

The client_id and client_certificate_path variables are only required for this purpose.

This template was developed from the starting point of https://github.com/fortinet/fortigate-terraform-deploy/tree/main/azure/7.2/ha-port1-mgmt-crosszone-3ports and then enhanced with managed identity SDN connector etc.
